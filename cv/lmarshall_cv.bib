@article{Rogacs2013,
abstract = {Reviewed are methods of nucleic acid (NA) extraction and sample preparation using an electrophoretic purification and focusing method called isotachophoresis (ITP). ITP requires no special surface chemistries or geometric structures, and can be achieved in a compact system with no moving parts. ITP is also compatible with a wide range of samples and lysing methods. Described are general principles of ITP, considerations around the application of ITP to biological samples (e.g., blood, urine and saliva), ITP electrolyte design considerations for fast and selective NA purification, and examples of ITP compatible lysing methods. Several of the challenges associated with purification of NAs are presented as well as methods to address these. Lastly, specific examples of lysing methods and ITP chemistries are described for purification of NA including host and pathogenic DNA, pathogenic rRNA, and host micro-RNA from complex sample matrices. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Marshall2014,
abstract = {We present a novel microchip device for purification of nucleic acids from 25. $\mu$L biological samples using isotachophoresis (ITP). The device design incorporates a custom capillary barrier structure to facilitate robust sample loading. The chip uses a 2. mm channel width and 0.15. mm depth to reduce processing time, mitigate Joule heating, and achieve high extraction efficiency. To reduce pH changes in the device due to electrolysis, we incorporated a buffering reservoir physically separated from the sample output reservoir. To reduce dispersion of the ITP-focused zone, we used optimized turn geometries. The chip was fabricated by injection molding PMMA and COC plastics through a commercial microfluidic foundry. The extraction efficiency of nucleic acids from the device was measured using fluorescent quantification, and an average recovery efficiency of 81{\%} was achieved for nucleic acid masses between 250. pg and 250. ng. The devices were also used to purify DNA from whole blood, and the extracted DNA was amplified using qPCR to show the PCR compatibility of the purified sample. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Shintaku2014,
abstract = {The simultaneous analysis of RNA and DNA of single cells remains a challenge as these species have very similar physical and biochemical properties and can cross-contaminate each other. Presented is an on-chip system that enables selective lysing of single living cells, extraction, focusing, and absolute quantification of cytoplasmic RNA mass and its physical separation from DNA in the nucleus using electrical lysing and isotachophoresis (ITP). This absolute quantitation is performed without enzymatic amplification in less than 5 min. The nucleus is preserved, and its DNA fluorescence signal can be measured independently. We demonstrate the technique using single mouse lymphocyte cells, for which we extracted an average of 14.1 pg of total RNA per cell. We also demonstrate correlation analysis between the absolute amount of RNA and relative amount of DNA, showing heterogeneity associated with cell cycles. The technique is compatible with fractionation of DNA and RNA and with downstream assays of each.},

@article{Qu2014,
abstract = {We report on our efforts to create an on-chip system to simultaneously purify and fractionate nucleic acids and proteins from complex samples using isotachophoresis (ITP). We have developed this technique to simultaneously extract extracellular DNA and proteins from human blood serum samples and deliver these to two separate output reservoirs on a chip. The purified DNA is compatible with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and proteins can be extracted so as to exclude albumin, the most abundant protein in serum. We describe significant remaining challenges in making this bidirectional method a robust and efficient technique. These challenges include managing channel surface adsorption of proteins, identifying the cause of observed reductions in low molecular weight proteins, and dealing with nonspecific binding of proteins and DNA.},
