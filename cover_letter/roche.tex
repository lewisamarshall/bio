% Opening statement
\opening{Dear hiring manager,}

% Letter body
I'm writing you to apply for the job listed as "Project Leader - Manufacturing, Science \& Technology (MSAT)". I hope you'll consider
me for the role. I see it as a great fit for my experience, as a subject matter expert in microfludics, a problem solver, and a 
multidisciplinary leader. 

I started my career as a subject matter expert on microfluidics. Our devices use critical wetting-driven features for a passive priming sequence. 
These features are controlled with careful injection molded geometry, good surface finish, and high degrees of cleanliness. 
We achieved quality through rigorous testing (using ANSI standard methods) and manufacturing controls, eventually achieving a device robustness of over 98 percent.

Beyond my experience as a consumables engineer, I've been managing multidisciplinary teams for over 6 years. This has included the challenging 
and fast-paced startup environment at Purigen Biosystems. I led teams launching our systems most successful products for nucleic acid purification. I led 
our internal engineering team and managed our external contractors to improve manufacturing reliability for our instrument. Most importantly, I led my 
teams to be mission focused and flexible problem solvers. 

Please see my resume, which details my experience and qualifications for the position. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions, and I hope we 
get a chance to discuss my fit for the role in person.
