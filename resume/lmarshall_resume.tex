    \subsubsection{Leadership}
       \begin{itemize}
        \item Managed a 15-member R\&D team and \$5M annual budget through the COVID-19 pandemic
        \item Created a sustainable on-call structure for customer through the R\&D team.
        \item Started a journal club to expose the team to the technological roots of the system.
       \end{itemize}
   \vspace{-0.1in}
    \subsubsection{Product Development}
      \begin{itemize}
       \item Integrated separate biological and microfluidic groups into one product-first group.
       \item Led the product teams for Purigen's two highest selling applications.
      \end{itemize}
   \vspace{-0.1in}
    \subsubsection{System Architecture}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Designed and prototyped microfluidic devices, including the device used to launch Purigen's first product.
        \item Designed the interfaces between the Purigen Ionic instrument and the microfluidic device, including future-proofing features for a long-term roadmap.
      \end{itemize}
   \vspace{-0.1in}
    \subsubsection{Software Development}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Wrote and maintained "pure", the business logic for the Purigen Ionic instrument.
        \item Created and maintained the self-test suite for the Purigen Ionic to simplify manufacturing process.
      \end{itemize}
   \vspace{-0.1in}
    \subsubsection{Data Analysis}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Created a bioinformatics pipeline to identify Purigen's advantage in coverage uniformity vs competitors.
        \item Wrote automated reporting infrastructure to charactarize individual instrument runs.
        \item Wrote data aggregation software to compile metrics from thousands of individual samples.
      \end{itemize}
